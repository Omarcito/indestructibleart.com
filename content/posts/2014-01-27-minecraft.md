Man, Minecraft is an unstoppable force. Unbelievable sales numbers on every platform its released on. Only couple of months on PS3 and it's already over 1 million units. Something like 10 million on Xbox360, 14 million on PC/Mac, and while I'm not sure of the exact sales numbers it was listed as the top selling iOS game for 2013. I'm sure when when it hits Xbox One and PS4 we'll see these numbers all over again. Nuts.
