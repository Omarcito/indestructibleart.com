<p>October is going to be a BIG month for us Marvel fans. 

<p>Hot on the heels of the Blockbusting, Action Packed, Critically Acclaimed *Original Sin*, we find ourself already 3 issues deep into the highly anticipated *Avengers & X-Men: AXIS* cross-over. As exciting as that is, let's not forget that us Marvel fans are still in mourning over the loss of the Best Avenger & X-Man that ever lived, James "The Wolverine" Howlett. Take a moment of silence as we honor the legacy of The Wolverine in October. And who **IS** this mysterious, silhouetted figure making an appearance on so many Mighty Marvel Magazines???

<p>Hey, look at that! Another cross-over in the Mighty Marvel fashion which will ultimately frustrate me to no end! And it even gets the pleasure of wrecking some of the _**worst comics I have ever loved**_. 

<p>But really though, who is this mystery character on the cover of these two books that they are blacking out?

<p>And again with the mysterious silhouette of a character holding what looks like some kind of device to block incoming attacks. What is going on here?</p>

These are some pretty great covers that will unfortunately do nothing to get me to buy a Dan Slott Spider-Man comic.

**DEADPOOL #36**

<img src="/images/forPosts/marvel-solicits-october-2014-deadpool36.jpg" class="center-img">

Get it? It’s funny because Iron Man is an Apple Fan Boy and Deadpool (whose obvs an Android user cause Android users are, like, edgey free-thinkers, right?) stole his plug and now Iron Man is hella bummed because his phone died after using it for, like, 15 minutes.

Stupid Apple Fan Boys.

Get it? Deadpool has a bigger gun and Hawkguy just has his wittle bow and arrow, and he’s all, like, “Deadpool, you jewk, you’re not playing by the wules!” That Deadpool. He’s so hilarious.

*(Making fun of bad Deadpool puns with bad puns about Deadpool. Classic Spencer D. Carnage. -Ed.)*

I wanna be there in when the brass sits down to discuss the debacle that has been the Pepsi Clear of the Marvel U, because the failure of the “Game Of Thrones with mutants” concept not selling like crazy is exactly what I want Ike Perlmutter to be ripping people’s heads off about.

Oh, poor X-Men comics with no Wolverine in them to help boost their sales. You get to die, too.</p>

Wolverine is gonna die, everybody!!!
