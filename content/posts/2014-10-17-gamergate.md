>"Silence isn't complicity. Silence might also be not letting a campaign of hate and chaos be taken seriously by not giving it a place at the table." **- Jeff Gerstman, [Giant Bomb](http://www.giantbomb.com/articles/letter-from-the-editor-10-17-2014/1100-5049/)**

This is not a popular opinion with the people I know, but it is exactly how I feel.

It's a shame that it took the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/technology/gamergate-women-video-game-threats-anita-sarkeesian.html?_r=0) writing about GamerGate before some of leading game websites around to write specifically about the disgusting things happening on the web lately tied to it. I'm not pointing fingers, I can understand why. I've felt mostly them same way. Why should the people behind these attacks be given the respect of reasonable discussion when they show a staggering lack of it in the actions they take? When do we cross the line that marks too much to remain silent?

I've been struggling with these questions since this whole mess started a few months ago. I wanted this all to just die down. Let it leave the popular internet consciousness, so all the hate filled anonymous people filling the web would stop clouding the discussion and some progress could be made. It seems that isn't possible. Things are only getting worse for those targeted. Only getting scarier for the world as a whole. I'll never be able to understand what these people think they accomplish with their actions. How threatening someone's life, or that of their families, is based in some moral code or superiority. It seems psychotic. I'm not totally sure how else to explain it. These are not the actions of sane people with a just goal. Their demands do not deserve to be listened to, when this is how they choose to act. But here we are. At the breaking point.

I don't know where to go from here.

Everyday I come right up to the point where I want to just give it all up. No longer associate myself with video games. Leave behind a group that used to be all about a love for a thing, but is now clouded by hate for something else. But thats not an answer. I just need to keep reminding myself look past it and find that the love is still there. That a few hateful people don't speak for my community. That the enumerable reasons that we came to this video games thing in the first place are still here.

Through this all we are lucky to have prominent figures out there to look up to. "Indie" or not, Game Devs or not, there are people who shine through this mess as examples of how to treat the people around you. The pressure on them is intense, and it'll keep growing.

>"But some of the people falling on the 'anti-' side of the GamerGate are employing the same sort of 'you are with us or against us' mentality. As those people get more frantic, they also damage the message they're trying to express."

This is where we need to take their example to heart. Don't let the pressure push you into a stance you can't come back from. Don't fall into the same tactics used against you. Stay strong. Stay level. Stay reasoned. What's the line? "Be the change you want to see"?

This is the only answer that makes sense to me. If we lose sight of that, that is when we've lost the fight.

I'll continue to love video games. I'll continue to support people regardless of gender, gender identity, race, or sexuality. I'll keep striving to find meaning in your art, with your message, not mine. I'll keep striving to bring to light all the awesome stuff video games has to offer. I have to believe that there is a greater number of people out here silently appreciating your creativity than that hateful mob. I just hope that you can still see it through all this mess. We're out here loving you. Don't lose sight of why you got started. Don't let a hateful mob push you away. To those of you getting the worst of it, I'm sorry. Stay safe. Stay strong. I hope you'll have something worth coming back to when we make it through to the other side.

####-These words are written by Omar, but the statement goes for all of us at Indestructible Art. Remember what brought you here. Keep exploring new ideas. Love the world around you, and the people in it.####
