Oculus VR shared some exciting new things at CES this year. They've been working on another prototype, which they call "Crystal Cove", that adds positional tracking and a new low persistence OLED display. Positional tracking seems like a huge step toward creating more realistic VR environments. Head tilts and body reactions will definitely add some more compelling game play and the new OLED display is supposed to clock in at a fraction of the refresh rate of the current model. The improvements to the display should make huge cuts to motion blur, judder, and hopefully reduce the VR sickness that some people experience.

The second bit of news should come as no surprise. John Carmack is not only working on hardware as CTO at Oculus, he's also working on games! In an interview with [Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2014/01/07/oculus-rift-game-development/), CEO Brendan Iribe dropped the bomb that Carmack would be working with other developers on in house software to showcase all that the Rift can do. Super rad. There has already been a lot of people making super interesting games for the Rift, or adding Rift support to existing games. Having in house teams making games that play up all the strengths of the hardware is only going to add to that pool. We all knew that Carmack wouldn't be out of the "game" game for very long, but this is awesome news. Also in that interview with Engadget, Oculus VR says to keep a look out on the job board as it fill in with more game developer positions in the future.

>"He's working on a lot of exciting tech," Iribe told us of Carmack's role. "But, his heart and soul and history certainly lies in the game-development side." That means, like Epic Games before them and id Software before Epic, Carmack and co. are working on software that'll showcase the Rift's many functions. "That's always been Epic's philosophy. And it's what allowed them to make what they made. It's certainly been id's philosophy in the past. It's been John Carmack's philosophy -- you gotta eat your own dog food here, and develop internal content also."
