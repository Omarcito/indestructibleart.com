<p>In the past two weeks I have seen three different cinematic videos for MOBA style games. I wanted to share them with you because all three contain similar features and I can't help but wonder how far developers are going to take the original themes from WarCraft 3's DotA mod.</p>

<p>If you know your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_the_Ancients">history</a> then it almost seems like a fluke we are stuck with a disparate set of heroes who are always featured running through a forest over and over again. If you are wondering what I am talking about check out the similarities in the first minute of these three cinematics.</p>

<p>The first video is Leaugue of Legendâ€™s most recent cinematic video. Next, is the premiere trailer for Motiga's new game Gigantic, and lastly is the recently announced, Battleborn, being developed by Gearbox Software. I understand that the gameplay of the later two games are going to be quite a bit different from the original DotA formula but it's peculiar that all of these games have a similar approach to characters and settings.</p>

<p>The original DotA was a mod in which a variety of WarCraft 3 game assets were put to great use each fulfilling a specific role. The character models and the map could have probably been themed after anything and we would have all stilled loved the gameplay. What if DotA Allstars had implemented a different WarCraft 3 map? Would we be seeing repeat mountain or frozen throne themed cinematics years later?</p>

<p>Not to be overly simplistic but if you were making an all new MOBA style game like Gearbox is with Battleborn or Motiga is with Gigantic, wouldn't you want to create an all new world with its own fiction instead of trying to mimic and cobble together one of the weakest aspects of a mod? Or does imitating the thematic settings of the first DotA have some type of relevance to making a successful MOBA?</p>

<p>Do you have high hopes for any upcoming MOBA games or are you getting tired of seeing some of the same stuff over and over again? For the record I think Gigantic looks pretty great.</p>
