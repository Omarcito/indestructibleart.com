title: "Indestructible Art 118: Black Wolverine"
subtitle: "Is the world ready for a black Wolverine? Nintendo cuts projections, Wally West is coming back, Justice League United userps Canada, and the crew talks better casting for Marvel movies"
summary: "Ryan returns and it's business as usual until someone mentions Matt Fraction. Steam Machines are still a thing so the gang dive deep into the pros and cons of Steam OS. Everyone rejoices at the news of Wally West  returning and it would seem Blue Beetle isn't too far behind. Bloomberg tweets about Nintendo's quarterly losses and journalists around the globe put their financial grad student caps on. We prefer the term Money Wizards. Notes and links for this episode can be found at http://www.indestructibleart.com/episodes/118.html"
