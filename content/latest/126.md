subtitle: "Titanfall and Dark Souls finally hit store shelves and the crew takes a look. Amazon wants to stream apps and Marvel is trying to re-invent the comic book medium by adding sound. True Detective Spoilers after the outro music"
summary: "The True Detective season finale hits everybody pretty hard. Stick around after the outro music to get everyone's take on the now completed television masterpiece. On the other hand Wolverine can't die soon enough as Ryan eagerly awaits the death toll on Marvel's three month long mortality hype machine countdown clock. Amazon is positioning themselves to stream games and apps but it might take more than money to iron out all the kinks. Marvel is working on yet another way to 'improve' the comic book reading experience by adding sound effects and Omar saves the episode by informing everyone about the new Frog Fractions 2 Kickstarter. Notes and links for this episode can be found at http://www.indestructibleart.com/episodes/126.html"
