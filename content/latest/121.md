title: "Indestructible Art 121: Totes Drive"
subtitle: "Superman may die again, Nintendo buys a bunch of it's own shares, John Romida and Geoff Johns take up the reins on Superman, and Amazon buys Double Helix."
summary: "It's time to come and support your IA community. Pledge now and get some rad stuff, like a donkey? Superman might be having a New 52 funeral but it probably won't last long with John Romida Jr. and Geoff Johns up next to bat on the Superman team. Amazon doubles down on the notion of making their own console after buying Killer Instinct creators Double Helix and Nintendo buys back a bunch of it's own shares. Notes and links for this episode can be found at http://www.indestructibleart.com/episodes/121.html"
